# Hi there, I'm Stormcph! 👋

I'm a software developer currently mainly working on [Lumina client](https://luminaclient.com), an alpha stage Minecraft cheating client that focuses on providing "ghost" features to players. The project is fairly new and has only been in development for about 2 weeks. The client is built using Java, and as I'm new to the language, I'm constantly learning and improving my skills.
